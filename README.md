# Wings Shop Website

This is a front-end only website named Wings Shop. The purpose of this website is to target the adventure lovers, peoples who love nature, peoples who love freedom and want to get involved in this sport.
They have now the oportunity to explore this sport through our test wings. 
The first idea of the page started with bicycles because I tryied to use my pictures but when I had to add a video to the page I realised I have no proper one to use on it then I decided to change the webpage theme whit the actual one.

## UX
 
This website was designed for existing and for potential lovers of flying to give them the ocasion to see a suit of wings as well as give them the ocasion to book a flight whit them.


## Features

#### Across the entire site

- Navbar: Allows all users to navigate to any part of the website without the use of browser 'back' and 'forward' buttons.
- Collapsed Navbar: Gives all users the ability to navigate the site whilst in mobile view.
- Social media links: Allows users to follow WingsShop on social media platforms available (the links are sending the users to homepage of each platform only)

## Technologies Used

- [Visual Code Studio](https://code.visualstudio.com/) 
     - I used this as IDE.

- [GitHub] 
     - I used this to push my website and save my commits on it. 

- [JQuery] 
     - I used this for the responsive navbar.

- [DevTools-LightHouse] 
     - I used this to test some parts of the code and to analyse how the webpage works online and how can be improved.

- [Bootstrap 4.3.1](https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/css/bootstrap.min.css)  
     - This was used for the Navbar, for making the site responsive, for grid system and also I used the modals for booking options .

- [Font Awesome](https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.8.2/css/all.css) 
     - This was used in the footer for the social media icons.

- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Heebo&display=swap) 
     - I used the font family of Heebo across the site.

     - I used this to edit the video presented on about.html.

- [Balsamiq]() 
     - I used this to create prototype of the page.

## Testing

- I used [This HTML validator](https://validator.w3.org/) to ensure my code was legal.
- I used [This CSS validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) to ensure my CSS was legal.
- I used [Color Contrast Checker ](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) to ensure that I have a minimum of contrast between
foreground and background colors.


## Viewport and responsive testing

-I used Boostrap to create responsive content in mobile devices and JQuery for the collapsing nav menu .

### index.html

1. From a mobile view the NavBar menu is verticaly collapsing pushing down the content to be visible for use in menu mode.  
2. In the mobile view the lead of the title will be hidden to leave a clean and easy to read page.


### wings.html

1. From a mobile view this is vertically alligned.
2. In the mobile view the images are coming on the bottom and the text and buttons on the top in three rows.
3. I wrapped all the content in a container and then gave a sepparate column for text and for pictures whit class col-12 col-md-6.

## Deployment

I used GitHub Pages to deploy my website by following the steps below:

1. I have created a repository in GitHub.

2. I used the Visual Studio Code to clone the GitHub repository copying the URL from my GitHub repository founded in 'Clone od Download Green button' then pasted in Visual Studio Code IDE.
  
3. I also used Visual Studio Code to commit my work and push it to the GitHub not using the terminal just using the Visual Studio Code buttons.

4. Then from my GitHub repository I have gone to settings, I have selected the master branch, I have saved and the website was published at:

    https://cubuletz.github.io/Firstmilestoneproject/

5. After this was done I did regular commits after every important update to the code, and I pushed the changes to GitHub.


### Content
- The pictures for 'home'and 'wings' was copied from [U-Turn website](http://www.u-turn.de/web/).
- The text for 'wings' also was copied from [U-Turn website](http://www.u-turn.de/web/).
- The text for 'about' is entirely written by me.
